# About
- Implemented a system which fetches all the songs alphabetically from top mp3
websites. Worked on a web crawling based solution. Implemented back-end
service by using Spring MVC in Java and PostgreSQL as a database.
- Used multi-threading to scrape the websites and stored the download links in
PostgreSQL database.
- Took approx. 3.2 seconds to scrape 500+ songs.
